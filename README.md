# Caesar-Cipher-Password-shift
This is a simple C++ program that allows a user to input a password and shift each character of the password by a specified number. The program applies a basic shift (similar to a Caesar Cipher) to each character of the password, and then displays both the original and the shifted password.

# Features:
Password Input: The user is prompted to enter a password (string).
Shift Value: The user is asked to provide a number by which each character in the password will be shifted.
Shifted Password: The program shifts each character of the password by the specified number and displays the resulting shifted password.
Visual Display: The original and shifted passwords are shown clearly, with a footer displaying the shifted password.
